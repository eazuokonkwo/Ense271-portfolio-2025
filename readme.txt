# Lab 1 -Grocery delivery app
# General Thought process
⋅⋅⋅My thought process when creating the story map for the grocery delivery app was user-centered and had all the key features that would address the essential user needs. I started by identifying the key activities a user performs when ordering groceries online which I grouped into epics to establish the backbone of the story map. Then I broke down each activity into smaller steps.

# Decisions I made when creating stories

⋅⋅1. I decided to add flexibility for user preferences
... Why: Different users have different and unique needs for instance, some users would like to order groceries but could be at work and would like it delivered at a different time. Also, some users don't remember the names of specific products and would like to filter by category to get what they need/ want.
... Result: In my story map I added tasks like" filter by categories" and "Select preferred delivery Time to address the diverse needs of users and improve user experience.

..2. I decided to include delivery notifications, live order tracking, and a contact support feature.
... Why: To enhance transparency, build customer trust, and provide a seamless post-purchase experience. Notifications keep users updated, live tracking offers real-time visibility, and contact support ensures quick resolution of any issues.
... Result: In my story map I added tasks like "Delivery notification", "Confirm Delivery", "Live tracking", "Rate delivery service", and "Contact support for delivery issues" to enhance transparency This ensures the delivery experience is seamless and reliable for users.

..3. I decided to add product descriptions for all items.
... Why: To help users make informed purchasing decisions by providing details about the products, such as size, ingredients, usage instructions, or nutritional information. This ensures clarity and improves the overall shopping experience.
...Result: In my story map I added a product description and product photo task to  enhance the usability of the app and support user confidence in their selections.

.. Extra Feature- I tried the color feature by grouping the release by color (MvP was indigo and Release 2 was purple  and the annotations feature by adding "IDEA" to some tasks.
